Code from the Anatole theme is MIT-licenced, and there's a copy next to it.
The content of this website does not yet have a licence, because I haven't thought that far ahead: all rights reserved, you can `git clone` the repository from GitHub, but nothing else.
Contact me if you want to use it for some reason.
